## Getting Started

Here's where I store my solutions for the self-paced [Object-Oriented Programming](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/gtx-introduction-to-object-oriented-programming-with-java) and [Data Structures & Algorithms](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/gtx-data-structures-and-algorithms) courses on GT's EdX. I audited these courses in preparation for entering the OMSCS program. This was my first introduction to Java, though I was already somewhat familiar with the conceptual material.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
