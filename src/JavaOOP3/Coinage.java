By the late 1870s, most denominations of British coins carried versions of the obverse design 
featuring Queen Victoria created by William Wyon and first introduced in 1838, the year after she 
acceded to the throne. The queen, approaching her 60th birthday, no longer resembled her 
numismatic depiction; and in February 1879, the private secretary to the queen, Sir Henry 
Ponsonby, informed the Deputy Master of the Royal Mint,[a] Charles Fremantle, that Joseph Edgar 
Boehm had been engaged to produce a medallic likeness of the queen that could be adapted for 
coinage purposes. Born in Austria, Boehm had trained as a medallist and had undertaken several 
sculptural commissions for the royal family.[1]

There was no deadline for the commission, and Boehm throughout often put aside the portrait in 
favour of more pressing projects. In June 1879 Victoria recorded in her journal that she had "sat 
to Böhm for a Bas Relief" and in August Ponsonby wrote to Fremantle that the head was done, 
leading the deputy master to become more involved in the project. Nevertheless, in November, Boehm 
wrote apologising for his lack of progress. He wrote again on 1 January 1880, stating that he had 
completed several small models, and mentioning a small crown he had placed on Victoria's head. 
Although this would be similar in style to the 1877 Empress of India Medal, Fremantle was dubious 
about the headgear and wrote to Charles Francis Keary at the British Museum asking if there was 
precedent in numismatics for this. Keary replied that "in the case of Greek coins I need not add 
the crowns are put on as if meant to be worn and not to tumble off at the slightest movement".[2]

In January 1880 the queen's daughter, Princess Louise, viewed Boehm's work, and suggested a larger 
crown, and on 20 February, Victoria paid a call on the sculptor, and approved the revised crown. 
Fremantle visited Boehm three days later, and, still concerned about the crown, asked for advice 
from the Tower of London and from the College of Arms. Victoria sat for Boehm again on 28 
February, and work had advanced to the point where Fremantle suggested having the Royal Mint's 
modeller and engraver, Leonard Charles Wyon (William's son) prepare steel coinage dies. Wyon did 
so, and pattern coins were struck several times over the next three years, but no version 
satisfied everyone involved. Boehm's design, with a crown fitting Victoria's head, was used for 
the Afghanistan Medal (1881). At the end of 1882, Fremantle proposed to Boehm that an entirely 
fresh start was needed, and the sculptor, busy with other commissions, agreed.[3]

Wyon was not initially involved in this second attempt, and Boehm invited the Viennese sculptor, 
Carl Radnitzky [de], under whom he had trained. Radnitzky stated that he had some of the work done 
by one of his students, whose identity is not known; the work may in fact have been done by 
Radnitzky himself. In August 1884 Fremantle had the chancellor of the Exchequer, Hugh Childers, 
show a pattern half crown to Victoria, who considered it a good likeness but criticised the fall 
of the veil on the coin, and stated that she preferred the existing coinage. By this time, the 
smaller crown had been placed upon her likeness again. Revisions were made, and more dies were 
sent from Vienna. In 1885 Leonard Wyon re-joined the project, and in January 1886 Fremantle 
authorised payment of 200 guineas (£210) to Boehm for his work to date, much of which was probably 
sent on to Radnitzky. By June of that year the project had advanced far enough that Fremantle told 
Boehm it would be desirable to have the new coins available for Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee in 
1887. The queen approved the new effigy in July, when she sat for Boehm again. A report of the 
session in the Court Circular prompted Wyon, who would have preferred to make a design himself, to 
write sadly to Fremantle. Further revisions were necessary, and it was not until March 1887 that 
the new chancellor, George Goschen, approved the coins, dies for which were prepared from Boehm's 
models by Wyon. They were then taken to be approved by Victoria, who gave her consent, though her 
hope that the coins bear some indication of the jubilee was resisted by Fremantle, who wished to 
have dies sent in the next post to the Australian branch mints. He stated that as they were first 
struck in the jubilee year, the coins would always be "associated with the idea of the Jubilee".[4]
